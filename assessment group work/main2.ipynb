    "Search and Optimisation are used in all disciplines of science and engineering, and in wider economy. In economical domains, they have been used in production planning (production mix, machine allocation), corporate finance (capacity planning, working capital management), investments (portfolio optimization, bond/stock portfolio management), and human resources (crew scheduling, office assignment), as well as transportation, agriculture and many others (Zhang, 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "In science and engineering, apart from machine learning, they have been used in such fields as office equipment ergonomics, setting construction norms and rules, creating optimal antenna shapes, TCP/IP packet routing, wireless network optimisation, and many others. The problem we have been tasked with in current assessment belongs to the latter – wireless network optimisation. It is one of vital uses of the optimisation methods as wireless networks of many kinds and shapes participate in daily lives of millions of people and practices of many – if not all - businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recent decades, it has been instrumental in economic and scientific development of all nations to provide working conditions for wireless data transmission, using GSM (and other) networks. Also, with growing use of Wi-Fi, relay systems had to be optimised. Optimal transmitter locations have had to be established en-masse in order  that the data be accessible in indoor and outdoor locations (F. Aguado Agelet, 2002). A number of methods have been hereby identified; however, researchers elected to use the Nelder-Mead method as it is “easier to implement and appears to be very robust”. Genetic algorithms, however, presented “worse computation-time behaviour”. Choosing the appropriate ways to approach and solve an optimisation problem seems crucial, and understanding the pluses and minuses of each and every one of them can save businesses and research teams a lot of time and effort. Even with separate implementations of the same algorithm, computation complexities, runtimes, and convergence capabilities can vary wildly, as each can have numerous variations, where the balance between exploration and exploitation (of solutions) also varies – as it will be shown in our examples later on.\n",

    "Problems of routing, or traversing graphs, loosely related to travelling salesman problem, are examined under the theoretical frameworks of theory of computation, “the branch that deals with what problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm, how efficiently they can be solved or to what degree” (Wikipedia, 2025). Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between L ⊆ NL ⊆ P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ EXPTIME ⊆ NEXPTIME ⊆ EXPSPACE (the first ones being Log-space, Nondeterministic Logarithmic-space, Polynomial Time, Non-Polynomial Time etc.) It is known that “one of the most famous open problems in computer science concerns whether P equals NP” – can every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved? The current problem of searching for optimal routes ha not found a complete solution that runs in polynomial time, however many optimisation methods have been proposed, and inferences can be made on their computational complexity, efficiency in terms of convergence and suitability for a given problem.\n",

    "Lance Fortnow gives a neat example of a TSP, whereas a certain saleswoman Mary must analyse the routes of all 48 capitals of contiguous US states (Fortnow, 2013). Whilst she intuitively drew a line connecting them, which is plausibly a “decent” one, there are 48! (48-factorial) solutions to be checked, in regular notation: 12,413,915,592,536,072,670,862,289,047,373, 375,038,521,486,354,677,760,000,000,000 (just over 12 novemdecillion). Concluding, “No wonder Mary’s laptop hadn’t finished in a week”, he goes on to expand that (apart from the proof that N!=NP) we may never find an algorithm that solves the problem all the time:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We need to rely on other tools, a combination of approximation, heuristics, and computational firepower, simply to do the best we can. NP-completeness gives us a common framework and allows us to create a toolbox of techniques that we can throw at these difficult-to-compute problems.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Since brute force and/or exhaustive search are an absolute impossibility, other methods for TSP-derived problems can be used. Greedy algorithms are especially useful by allowing us to use ‘ad-hoc’ solutions repeatedly in hope of arriving at a good solution, globally (Thomas H. Cormen, 2001): they must have a “greedy-choice property: a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal (greedy) choice”; it also needs an “optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems”. Of course, a particular optimal route contains optimal sub-routes, therefore Disjktra’s algorithms just works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta-heuristic algorithms are another great option. Many of those are nature-inspired and provide great exploration of the search space in practicable computing time and within limited resources. Some are very ingenuous. Stigmergy is omnipresent in nature and even we humans use the signs (natural or manmade) in the environment to navigate through unknown spaces, and even unknowingly co-operate, not in a dissimilar way from ants in an ant colony (more on ACO algorithm later). For example, writing a note well before a broken footpath, “no throughway” will save anyone who wants to get through in a good amount of time. In addition, some nature-inspired algorithms, like genetics algorithms, produce results that mimic human creativity. David Goldberg expands on the role of chance in directed search, following the musings of the mathematician J Hadamard, “…even though discovery is not a result – cannot be a result – of pure chance, it is almost certainly guided by directed serendipity”, emphasising that the role for chance in human-like discovery is its (blind) ability to “juxtapose different notions” (Goldberg, 2006). He goes on to state that comparisons have been made “with certain human search processes commonly called innovative or creative”. Indeed, it has been pointed out how such pure “chance” in GAs created an antenna for NASA Space Technology 5, where “evolutionary algorithms can be used to search the design space and automatically find novel antenna designs that are more effective than would otherwise be developed” (Gregory. S. Hornby, 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, GAs’ use in our problem, essentially an optimization of Wireless Sensor Networks, is an overkill as only a tiny fraction of routes will be even valid, potentially leading to a wase of computing resources. Selcuk Okdem (Okdem S, 2009) et al suggest use of Ant Colony Optimization (Okdem S, 2009), for a few reasons, among others that “Although WSNs are used in many applications, they have several restrictions including limited energy supply and limited computation and communication abilities”. Moreover, as “channel bandwidth is limited, protocols should have capability of performing local collaboration to reduce bandwidth requirements”. Here we can proceed to problem statement, where we can look at it closer from a few angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "An organisation has decided to deploy a number of weather sensors communicating wirelessly, between one another, and two base stations, in New Forest area of England. The resources are limited and there are bandwidth constraints, and related latencies in communication. The table below explores the technical abilities of the said sensors, where distances between them dictate the network performance. There are 150 units randomly within an square area, where base stations are at (-5000, 5000) and (5000, -5000), and the sensores are anywhere in between. Geo data has been provided by the organisation in the form of a csv file. Eucladean distances have to be calculated from the formula for d, as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having done that, at least two different algorithms must establish the best routes for each sensor to a base station (relaying via other sensors), indexed from 0 to 149, taking into consideration the communication efficiencies."

    "The problem as described, does not lend itself to a straightforward one-size-fits-all solution. It is a problem of two seemingly opposite objectives. To bring up an example from real life, buying a motorcycle may be an exercise in a multi-objective optimization: price, vehicle weight-to-bhp ratio, comfort (seat height, handlebar-rider’s arm angle), acceleration 0-60, fuel use, and top speed may all be factors. If the motorcycle were to be used for commuting long distances through city traffic, comfort, fuel use, vehicle weight and (perhaps) acceleration would be priorities, whilst top speed would be nearly irrelevant. Used as a second vehicle for weekend fun on country roads, or track-days, acceleration, weight-to-power ratio, and top speed would come first, comfort would be less viable, and fuel use – irrelevant (assuming enough financial means). \n",

    " Some functions need to be maximised, and some – minimised; in everyday parlance, some denote a ‘good thing’, and some a ‘bad thing’. In our problem example, latency is our ‘bad thing’, which needs minimising all along, whereas edge-to-edge transfers have to be maximised on each potential route, thus avoiding the edges that constitute unnecessary bottlenecks on the way.\n",
    " \n",
    "Utilising reciprocals is a good way to achieve this end in practice, including here. We have decided together, upon consultation with the lecturer, to use this method, and upon a trial-and-error process, we settled on certain weights, 1 being the “alpha” and 150 – the “beta”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```f(x,y)= α⋅x + β⋅1/y,```\n",

    "For obvious reasons, the transfer on any “bottleneck” should be as high as possible, therefore the variable x needs to be maximised. Conversely, the sum of on-route latencies must be minimised, hence the use of the inverse variable. The entire objective f(x,y)  function shall be maximised for every route from each node to either base station, whichever is better. The algorithms make ad-hoc stochastic choices on which base station should be chosen, and optimal one is always found, along with a route that (potentially) is the optimal one. The use of potentially is intentional. Only gradient-based methods based on well-defined functions yield a 100% guarantee of nice and accurate result of optimisation, all other methods being on a spectrum, whose other far end is lack of convergence. These often get put into one ‘bag’ named ‘metaheuristic’ (discussed in the work as cited):\n",

Some methods lack merit completely, as gradient methods, as there is no neat well-define mathematical objective function to optimise. Similarly, linear programming would be ill suited. We are left - more or less - with metaheuristic methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>It must be noted that the work has been done by a number of students. Wherever an author means \"absolute cost\" of a path or route, it shall mean \"objective function value\" on that path/route, as per the definition above**. Let us remember that this 'loose' use of the word 'cost' will allow us to think of it in terms of benefit, rather than traditional meaning of 'cost', and when the \"absolute cost\" is maximised, it shall mean fulfilling the objectives of our work, and indeed a positive outcome.</B>\n",

    "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): The paper (Selvarajan, 2024) highlights ACO's strength in exploring diverse solutions and its biologically inspired approach; it mimics the foraging behaviour of ants.

This will be performed and discussed in ACO documentation in more detail, together with elementary statistical analysis of the ACO parametrisation process.\n",

    "Simulated Annealing: This method is praised for its ability to escape local optima by simulating the annealing process of metals. However, it is mentioned that convergence can be slow and is not guaranteed in all cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's Algorithm: The paper (Selvarajan, 2024) discusses Dijkstra's Algorithm as highly reliable for shortest path problems in graphs. It is noted for its accuracy and guaranteed convergence but is limited to specific types of optimization problems. It seems to be particularly well suited to our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic Algorithms (GAs): Genetic Algorithms are recognized for their robustness and ability to handle complex search spaces. They are good at exploration but may lack consistency and convergence in some scenarios. We must note their apparent stochastic ‘creativity’, or rather, a wide space of solutions tested. Of course, in our scenario, many routes created will make no ‘sense’ as there will be no such connections / edges in our graph.\n",

    "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): We looked at the available papers, which adapt PSO, which is more suited to optimising non-differentiable and continuous-value functions rather than routing problems, to the extent that we found a solution.

    "<b>Population Initialization:</b> The algorithm starts with random initialization of the population which in this case is the various routes from the specified origin to a specified destination (base station). This is done in the function `dga_init_population()`where the number of routes generated is also specified as an argument. The function generated random values excluding the origin and destination regardless of whether they have end connectivity and at the end prepending and appending the origin and destination respectively. The validity of the paths will be checked in subsequent stages. A list of randomly generated routes is returned form the function.<br>\n",
    "<b>Fitness Function Evaluation:</b> The next stage is calculating the end-to-end fitness function which incorporates the end-to-end bandwidth and total latency using the cost function defined for this project. This is done in the `bandwidth_latency_calc()` function and while doing all this, it updates the global variables ‘solutions’ and ‘dga_data’ which carry map visualization data and best solutions (for the solutions file) data. The function returns the population (routes) with their corresponding end-to-end fitness function values.<br>\n",
    "<b>Filtering out valid paths:</b> The next stage is filtering out valid paths from the ones that are created. Since the algorithm has no specified formulae in the way the path is created, many invalid paths have a high chance of being created. Therefore, there is need to exclude them so that the subsequent stages run on quality routes. This process is run in the `get_valid_paths()` function. The function eliminates any chromosome with an end-to-end fitness value of 0 as this means there is no end-to-end connectivity. It is at this stage that we determine if there is no valid path completely to a particular station that has been generated. If that is the case, the algorithm reruns from scratch and seeks a path to the alternative base station using the processes described above.<br>\n",
    "<b>Fitness Selection Process:</b> Using the valid paths determined by the previous stage, a selection process is carried out using the tournament selection method. Here the selection is based on the solutions that have the highest fitness function values since our main aim is to maximize the values. This is carried out in the `tournament_fitness_selection()` function which has a set number of maximum possible winners in the function parameters. The result of this function is quality solutions which will be improved in the subsequent stages. If the quality solution left is just 1, the solution is returned without proceeding further.<br>\n",
    "<b>Crossover:</b> Just before this, the process of preparing the chromosomes for crossover is done. This entails pairing best solutions in 2s since the crossover process requires pairs of chromosomes. This is alongside the type of crossover (single-point/ two-point/ uniform) as arguments to the function `crossover()` where the process happens. The result of the process is 2 children with mixed genes (nodes/sensors in the routes) that could potentially be better solutions than their parents.<br>\n",
    "<b>Mutation:</b> This process seeks to introduce new information to the gene. In the shortest route problem that we seek to solve, mutation is done in the form of swapping genes (sensors) for 2 reasons:\n",
    "1. There is a limited number of valid sensors that can be introduced to the solution\n",
    "2. We aim at having sensors with valid end-to-end connectivity values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of swaps made is determined by the mutation rate defined in the function `mutate()` where this entire process runs. The nodes that are to be swapped exclude the origin and destination/base station nodes which are the fixed.\n",

    "The above processes are consolidated into the function `dga_run()` which takes in all the requires parameters. The parameters are:\n",
    "1. `origin`: the origin from which you want to traverse the space.\n",
    "2. `destination`: the destination node which you want to get to.\n",
    "3. `population length`: the length of the population for the first generation.\n",
    "4. `generations (optional)`: the maximum number of generations that you would want to you do work with (termination criteria). Default is set to 10.\n",
    "5. `mutation rate (optional)`: The percentage of the population that will be mutated. Default is set to (0.1).\n",
    "6. `crossover type (optional)`: The type of crossover that will be implemented. The default is set to 'single-point'.\n",
    "7. `selection limit (optional)`: The number of winners that should be selected at the minimum during the fitness selection stage. Default is set to 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is tested for each base station. The population generated point to a certain base station and if a valid solution to that base station is found, the alternate base station is tried. This is done using a try-except statement in the wrapping function `discrete_genetic_algorithm()` which is the main function of this algorithm and is called in the main function file. The result of this function is the plotting data that has the best and possible paths alongside the solutions variable that has the data of the best path that will be recorded in the solutions file. The above processes are illustrated in the flow chart below."

    "#### ACO - Ant Colony Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm was used in searching for the optimal path from any node to either of the base stations. The algorithm employs ‘ants’ by the way of iterative process, in a stigmergic fashion working ‘together’, although not concurrently or in parallel (we looked into these but deemed them redundant), marking paths with pheromones for more ‘ants’ to follow in following iterations. The Elitist ACO approach adds an extra pheromone level for the ant discovering the best path. Higher graph edge’s pheromone level may increase the probability of an ant transition to it, but the process is still stochastic by utilization of a roulette wheel method, increasing ants’ chances at exploration and preventing the model from being too deterministic. Evaporation has been used in both algorithms. Global pheromone update has been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process Flow, Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing Table Creation: The algorithm starts with the creation of an adjacency matrix to represent the geographical data (from co-ordinates). This is done by calculating the Euler distances and the bandwidth connectivity between the nodes (acting as graph weights) as per the Mbps table supplied. This matrix will be essential in creating random routes that have end-to-end connectivity at the fastest rate possible. One algorithm (RH) used out_nodes and out_pheros structures, to ease the coding process, interpretability, and readability. They are essentially a graph adjacency list, and its auxiliary matrix of pheromones, respectively. RH algorithm used the Elitist approach, wherein the elite ant left a 3 x higher pheromone than regular ants. SM code used classic ACO solution, with equal weight given to all ants’ pheromones. In SM implementation, ants were deployed not only from the origin node (as in RH code), but also some adjacent nodes, to improve exploration; he called them ‘helper ants’ – it is a novel idea. Both implementations used the version of calculating probability of single transition to another edge in the graph with the value of tau to the power of alpha, as well as eta to the power of beta divided by their summation. Although it arguably adds some pre-determination into the method, it possibly allows us to reduce the number of iterations and save on computing power. Evaporation rate was 0.45 in both, striking a balance between the persistence of emerging route solutions (pheromone staying power), and stochastic exploration of new / poorly explored unexplored paths. The cumulative probability in both programs was used to construct a roulette wheel, where randomness introduced an extra level of exploring the search space. When routing to one destination or the other, a pseudo-random function was utilized. Both algorithms use loop removal, implemented in slightly different ways.\n",
    "Two operations are weighty for the algorithm’s workings, i.e. positive and negative feedback. Positive feedback takes information from the ants in order to apply stigmergy to the system.  After all ants within an iteration have constructed their paths from the source to destination and graph cycles are removed, the pheromone intensity on an edge (i, j) is adjusted:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt](images/Formula1.png)\n",
    "![Alt](images/Formula2.png)\n",
    "    \n",
    "xk(t) is the solution of ant k; f(xk(t)) is the quality of the solution (cost of the path); Q > 0 and is a constant; nk is the number of ants.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had to correct one of the programs in order to reflect the fact that our objective function is not strictly a ‘cost’ function, but a ‘benefit’ function to be maximized. Hence, the function value was hereby raised to a power of positive, rather than negative, exponent (here: 1 rather than -1) It enhanced the algorithm, although it still seemed to work and converge satisfactorily well even before that correction. \n",
    "Negative feedback was a simple run through the pheromone matrix by multiplying a scalar (1- ϱ) by it. In both apps, we used 0.45 and it was found effective.\n",
    "The only stopping criteria we used is the number of iterations. Another could be used, too: all (or most) ants follow the same path. It could lead to waste of computational power in non-critical solutions, though. We shall expand on it in the next part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameter Choice, Experiments and Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Having coded, troubleshooted and tested the code, it was time for analysis of the solution files and fine-tuning the parameters. RH code initially set the parameters to the same levels as SM (ants_n=20, iterations=10), but performed many tests and performance and quality analysis to establish a good balance for the apploication domain (weather monitoring system). A chat with OpenAI’s ChatGPT was used, provided with 9 detailed solution files and timings (ChatGPT, 2025). Increases from 10 to 15 and then 20 iterations offered merely modest improvements in the quality of solutions measured by mean objective function for all routes in 10, 15, 20 iteration version (+4.39% and +4.30%, respectively, and only the latter is marginally statistically significant); however, the timings went up from 3 to 5 then 7 minutes per execution. The tests for each of the three iteration parameters were repeated 3 times, and no difference in run time or solution quality was noted. Similarly, increasing the number of ants from 20 to 30 did not affect either the run times, or the quality of the solution.\n",
    "The recommendation for our optimization problem would be to persist with the lower values of iterations as sufficiently accurate and more computationally effective. The increase from 15 to 20 iterations, while “marginally significant, it may justify the cost in high-stakes scenarios”, like high precision or critical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tweaks, flowchart, discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "We added the following tweak to the transition probability formulae, that is also commonly used in travelling salesman problem (which shares similarities with and differences from ours).\n",

    "where: τij(t) is the pheromone intensity; ηij(t) (eta) is a priori effectiveness of the move from i to j; α > 0, β > 0 are predefined constraints; ηij(t) = 1; dij(t) improves the attractiveness of the edge (i, j); dij(t): cost between edge (i, j); \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further performance comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "When the two ACO algorithms were run, along with all the other algorithms, it came to our attention that they perform quite differently. Hence we have decided to carry out another, less formal performance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a table of timings (Table 1) on how long the runtime was on optimization of routes from all 150 nodes to one of the base stations. Where applicable, same parameters (ant number, iterations) were set. Each algorithm was run 150 times for every node as a source parameter, and an aggregate time has been indicated.\n",

    "The leader, as expected, was the Dijkstra’s Algorithm, closely trailed by Simulated Annealing. It proved difficult to pinpoint concrete reasons why there was a discrepancy between the two ACO implementations. It seems that ACO (SM) must have been much more exploratory than ACO (RH).\n"

Meanwhile, the cooling of the temperature happens at the set rate. During the initial iterations, the probability of a worse of solution being used as an acceptable solution is high since the high temperature is used in calculating the probability of a path being picked. As the temperature goes down, the influence of temperature in determining whether a solution will be accepted is low. The formulae used in determining whether a solution is picked is as follows:<br>\n",
    "`delta = current path cost – best path cost`<br>\n",
