    "To visualize the solutions produced by the various algorithms, we implemented a real and interactive geographic map with the sensors and the base station. This was done using Folium, a Leaflet JavaScript library which we interacted with through an API. We followed through the API documentation (Story 2013) to achieve the following:\n",
    "1. Show the best route obtained from a sensor to a base station by a particular algorithm\n",
    "2. Show all other possible routes found (not the best but have end-to-end connectivity)\n",

    "The locations of the sensors were provided in form of X, Y grid coordinates in meters for purposed of calculating their heuristic distances. However, since the API needs values of geographic coordinates, coordinates of the sensors had to be computed and represented on the leaflet. The computation of geographic coordinates from X, Y grid coordinates was inspired by the Haversine formula (Scripts 2024)."

The ‘best path’ and ‘possible paths’ have been categorically layered in a way that you can view each type independently without struggle. For further visual intuition, the best path’s sensors have been marked with pins which show their sensor IDs. This can be done using a layer controller found on the top left corner.
